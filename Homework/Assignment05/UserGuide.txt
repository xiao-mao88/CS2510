To Play ZTypeWorld:

On the game board you will see words starting from the top and slowly falling towards the bottom.

The goal is to continuously type each word that you see, to prevent them from reaching the bottom.

If it any word reaches the bottom, it is GAME OVER.

Remember, you can only type ONE word at a time, the word that you are currently typing will change to a RED color, while all the other words will stay their original BLUE color.
