How to Play:
1) Every time you click on the board, a cell will be revealed.
   If it is not a bomb, then numbers will appear on them indicating how many bombs are next to it.
2) Using this information, try to reveal all non-bomb cells
3) If you do click a bomb, it will trigger an explosion and you will end the game

Added For Extra Credit:
Bomb-tracking-
The bombs will be kept track of utilizing the number of flags the user has placed down
** Be careful, though, the number of bombs will decrease even if you place a flag in the wrong place!

Color-Changing-
The color of the number on the revealed cell will be different based on the number of bombs next to it

--> Based off the original minesweeper game
